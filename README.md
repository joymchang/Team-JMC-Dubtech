Models
------------------------------------------------------------
Logistic Regression Model:

The Logistic_Regression model uses TF-IDF on HTML snippets (affected_html_elements and supplementary_information) to predict which WCAG reference (e.g., 1.4.6 Contrast Enhanced) each accessibility violation maps to.

------------------------------------------------------------
Logistic Regression Matrix Model:

The model uses TF-IDF + Logistic Regression on HTML snippets to predict which of the 7 accessibility impact categories (Blind, Low Vision, Color Blind, Motor, Cognitive, Auditory, Situational) each violation affects.
